# C File Function Parsing Web App

## Description
This Python Streamlit app parses C source files (.c) and automatically inserts printf statements to log when functions are entered and exited. It provides a simple web interface where users can upload a C file, view the modified version in the browser, and download the updated file.

## The App Outputs
A modified C source file containing additional printf statements for:
- "Entering function" at the start of each function.
- "Exiting function" before each return statement.

## Key Data Points Inserted
Function Name: Extracted from the function signature in the C source file.  
Function Entry Log: Prints "Entering function <function_name>" when the function starts.  
Function Exit Log: Prints "Exiting function <function_name>" before each return statement.
